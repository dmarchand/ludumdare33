Ludum Dare 33 Entry


You start out as a weak monster in a dungeon

Stupid heroes sometimes enter the dungeon like jerks to steal your treasure and stuff

Go eat them before they get your treasure!

Defeat Conditions:
Treasure all gone

Win Conditions:
None. Arcade-y

Gameplay:
Free movement in a fixed dungeon (no procedural in game jam :( )

Heroes enter the dungeon at fixed entry points like a tower defense

Bumping into heroes deals damage to them. Bigger heroes need to be bumped more often

Heroes tend to make a reasonable path towards the treasure

Score measured on heroes killed and/or time elapsed

Bigger and more heroes spawn as more time elapses


Unknown:
Do you level up in any way? There probably has to be some minor decisions here. Perhaps run speed vs strength
