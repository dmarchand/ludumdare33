Ludum Dare 33 Entry


You start out as a weak monster in a dungeon

Stupid heroes sometimes enter the dungeon like jerks to steal your treasure and stuff

Go eat them before they get your treasure!

## Defeat Conditions:
Treasure all gone

## Win Conditions:
None. Arcade-y

## Gameplay:
Free movement in a fixed dungeon (no procedural in game jam :( )

Heroes enter the dungeon at fixed entry points like a tower defense

Bumping into heroes deals damage to them. Bigger heroes need to be bumped more often

Heroes tend to make a reasonable path towards the treasure

Score measured on heroes killed and/or time elapsed

Bigger and more heroes spawn as more time elapses

Sometimes other cool monster friends show up to help maybe, so the dungeon doesn't seem so lonely


## Unknown:
Do you level up in any way? There probably has to be some minor decisions here. Perhaps run speed vs strength. I also like the idea of picking a new monster. Perhaps a static UI that takes up 33% of the right side of the screen with stats like heroes killed, time elapsed, and choices about really simple upgrades.
